## Description

    This is a refactored website that I did for Horiseon. I updated the accessibility standards by using alt attributes. 
    I used semantic elements and edited header attributes to create a more logical structure. I edited the title to be more concise and descriptive.
    I commented on most sections of the HTML and CSS files to describe what they do.
